# CHANGELOG #

## Version 0.7 ##

* added mouse support from newer versions of termbox
* in the case of key events, either key or char are now nil instead of 0.
* added termfx.copyregion, termfx.scrollregion and the same as buffer
  methods
* added termgfx.getcell() and buffer:getcell()
* fixed a bug in termfx.colorinfo() for NORMAL output mode.

## Version 0.6 ##

* changed termfx.attributes() and  and buf:attributes() to have optional
  arguments, defaulting to the current default attributes. This way you
  can for example only change the foreground color.
* "fixed" Makefile to work from luarocks on Mac OS X. The problem was
  that termbox's waf build system would just compare the contents of $CC
  to gcc or clang, but when called from luarocks it contains some more
  stuff... unsetting CC before calling waf configure fixes this.
* setting cells to chars < ' ' will now set to ' '

## Version 0.5 ##

* added termfx.rgb2color(), termfx.grey2color() and termfx.colorinfo()
* added buf:printat() and buf:blit() methods
* added termfx.size() and buf:size()
* added elapsed field to event table returned from termfx.pollevent()
* made termfx.pollevent accept nil as timeout value, treating it as if
  none were given.
* more samples
* fixed incredibly stupid bug :(

## Version 0.4 ##

* removed termfx.utf8 stuff. You should really be using a dedicated lib.
* added termfx.printat()
* lua 5.3 beta compatibility

## Version 0.3 ##

* initial release
