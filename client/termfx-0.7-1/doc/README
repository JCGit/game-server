## Introduction ##

TermFX is a library for fancy terminal output based on termbox. It means
to reduce the weirdness termbox has in places, and provide some additional
utilities like offscreen buffers, and generally a more lua like interface.
TermFX has been tested with lua 5.1 to 5.3 beta on Linux and Mac OS X.

Basic usage is very similar to termbox, but also different enough that it
warrants some of its own documentation.

Like in termbox, the screen is made up of cells, each consisting of a
character, a foreground- and a background attribute. For an explanation
of these see `termfx.attribute()`. Unlike termbox, the top left coordinate
is 1, 1, and named colors work in all output modes.

All rendering is done into a buffer, whose contents is then drawn to the
actual display using the function `termfx.present()`. In the following
discussion of the functions, when I write that something operates on the
terminal, it actually operates on this buffer.

## Installing ##

The version of termbox I built this against is included in the archive.
So all you need to do is to cd into the source directory and call

    make && make install

If you want to build termfx against a newer version of termbox, just type

	make distclean

That will remove the termbox subdirectory. If you subsequently call make,
the most recent version of termbox will be pulled from the github repo.
If you don't have git installed, you can download the most recent termbox
branch from <https://github.com/nsf/termbox/archive/master.zip>, unpack
it into the source directory, rename the resulting `termbox-master` directory
to termbox, and then the above should work.

When using luarocks, a simple

	luarocks install termfx

should do the trick, or alternatively, if you've already downloaded it,
enter the source directory and type

	sudo luarocks make

which should do what you want. Again, if you want to build against a more
recent version of termbox than the included, just call `make distclean`
before that, and all should be well.

## Using ##

Load the module with:

    termfx = require "termfx"

You must call `termfx.init()` before you can do any output. At the end of
your program, you should call `termfx.shutdown()`, however, the library
registers an atexit handler that does this when the interpreter exits,
if it has not been done before.

All coordinates on termfx are 1-based, meaning the top left corner of
the terminal has the coordinates 1, 1 and the bottom right corner has
the coordinates `termfx.width()`, `termfx.height()`.

Note that `termfx.init()` sets the terminal into a mode where you can no
longer see any error messages the program might throw. It is therefore
recommended that, at least during development, you wrap your main loop
into a pcall()ed function, like so:

	termfx.init()
    ...
    ok, err = pcall(function()
		repeat
			evt = termfx.pollevent()
			...
		until some_exit_condition
    end)
    termfx.shutdown()
    if not ok then print("Error: "..err) end

### Functions ###

#### Main functions ####

`termfx.init()`
:	initializes the library and the display. `termfx.init()` may fail
	and in that case throws an error. All of the other functions, except for
	buffer and cell constructors and methods, work only after the terminal
	has been initialized using this function, and will silently fail, or in
	the case of queries return nil, if that is not the case. Because of this,
	you can for example check whether the terminal has been initialized by
	querying its width and checking the result against nil.

`termfx.shutdown()`
:	shuts the library down and puts the terminal into a sane mode for
	normal usage.

`w = termfx.width()`
:	returns the width of the terminal.

`h = termfx.height()`
:	returns the height of the terminal.

`w, h = termfx.size()`
:	returns width and height of the terminal.

`termfx.clear([fg, bg])`
:	clears the terminal. If no arguments are given, the default
	foreground and background attributes are used (see
	`termfx.attributes()`), otherwise the default attributes are set
	from the arguments passed to `termfx.clear()` and then used.

`fg, bg = termfx.attributes([fg, bg])`
:	sets or, if called without arguments, gets the default foreground
	and background attributes. Attributes are colors and formatting like
	bold or underline. Colors are simple integers in the range 0-255, or
	one of the color constants from `termfx.color`, and formatting is one
	or more of the constants from `termfx.format`. Attributes and
	constants can be added together for the final foreground or
	background attribute. Returns the default foreground and background
	attributes, or those just set.

`col = termfx.rgb2color(r, g, b)`
:	maps a set of rgb values to a xterm color number. r, g, b must be in
	the range 0..5, which makes up the 216 available colors. Returns a
	color number, which is corrected for the output mode in use, or nil
	if the input could not be mapped to a color number. This function
	only works in `termfx.output.COL216` and `termfx.output.COL256`
	modes, in the other modes it will always return nil.

`col = termfx.grey2color(v)`
:	maps a single greyscale value to an xterm color number. v must be in
	the range 0..25, which makes for 26 grey values. Returns a color
	number, which is corrected for the output mode in use, or nil if the
	input could not be mapped to a color number. This function only
	works in `termfx.output.COL256` and `termfx.output.GREYSCALE` modes,
	in the other modes it will always return nil. Also, as in
	`tfx.output.GREYSCALE` mode there are only 24 available grey values,
	the values 0 and 1 map to the same color number, as do 24 and 25.

`value, r, g, b = termfx.colorinfo(n)`
:	returns the color value (a rgb string with format "#abcdef") and
	red, green and blue values for a color number. The range of n
	depends on the current output mode:

	* 0..255 for `termfx.output.COL256`
	* 0..215 for `termfx.output.COL216`
	* 0..23 for `termfx.output.GREYSCALE`
	* 0..15 for `termfx.output.NORMAL`
	
	For values outside of the valid range for the current output mode,
	the function will return nil.

`termfx.present()`
:	output the contents of TermFX's back buffer, into which the
	rendering is done, to the terminal.

`termfx.setcursor(x, y)`
:	sets the cursor to position x, y and unhides it.

`termfx.hidecursor()`
:	hides the cursor.

`cel = termfx.newcell([, ch [, fg [, bg]]])`
:	creates a new offscreen cell. You can use cells in functions like
	`termfx.setcell()` or `termfx.rect()`. If you pass any or all of the
	arguments, they are used in the construction of the cell, otherwise
	the respective values default to space (' ') for the char, and the
	default foreground and background attributes. The returned cell has
	3 attributes you can read or set, which are ch, fg and bg. For more
	information see the section on TermFX's cells below.

`termfx.setcell(x, y [, cel])` or `termfx.setcell(x, y [, ch [, fg [, bg]]])`
:	sets the cell with the coordinates x, y on the terminal. For the
	cells attributes, you can pass in a cell as created by
	`termfx.newcell()`, or values. If you pass any or all of the arguments,
	they are used for the cell on the terminal, otherwise the respective
	values default to space (' ') for the char, and the default
	foreground and background attributes.

`cel = termfx.getcell(x, y)`
:	gets the cell from the coordinates x, y on the terminal. If x or y lie
	outside of the terminal, nil is returned.

`buf = termfx.newbuffer(w, h)`
:	creates a new offscreen buffer with width w and height h. The new
	buffer gets the default foreground and background attributes as its
	local defaults. This may be changed with a method call on the buffer.
	For more information see the section on buffer methods below.

`termfx.blit(x, y, buf)`
:	blits the contents of the buffer to the terminal placing the buffers
	top left corner at the coordinates x, y.

`termfx.rect(x, y, w, h [, cel])` or `ok = termfx.rect(x, y, w, h [, ch [, fg [, bg]]])`
:	draws a rectangle on the terminal with top left at x, y and width w
	and height h.  For the rectangles attributes, you can pass in a cell
	as created by `termfx.newcell()`, or the values. If you pass any or
	all of the arguments, they are used for the rectangle on the
	terminal, otherwise the respective values default to space (' ') for
	the char, and the default foreground and background attributes.

`termfx.copyregion(tx, ty, x, y, w, h)`
:	copy the the rectangle starting at x, y with width w and height h to
	position tx, ty on the terminal. Source and target rectangle may overlap.

`termfx.scrollregion(x, y, w, h [, sx [, sy]])`
:	scrolls the rectangle starting at x, y with width w and height h on the
	terminal by sx and sy. sx and sy are optional and default to 0. If they
	have other values, only their sign is used. Scrolling is by 1 column or
	row at most.

`termfx.printat(x, y, what [, w])`
:	prints a string to the terminal at position x, y up to maximum width
	w. If w is omitted, it defaults to the length of what. what can be a
	string, or a table of cells. If it is a string, it is printed in the
	default foreground and background colors, if it is a table of cells,
	the char and attributes from each cell are used.

`mode = termfx.inputmode([newmode])`
:	sets the terminal input mode. Valid modes are `termfx.input.ESC`,
	`termfx.input.ALT`. If the newmode argument was not given, returns
	the current input mode, otherwise returns the mode just set.
	
	Modes are:

	* `termfx.input.ESC`: when an ESC sequence is in the buffer and it
		doesn't match any known ESC sequence, ESC means `termfx.key.ESC`
	* `termfx.input.ALT`: when an ESC sequence is in the buffer and it
		doesn't match any known sequence, ESC enables `"ALT"` modifier for
		the next keyboard event.
	* `termfx.input.MOUSE`: specify this if you are interested in mouse
		events. This can be added / or'ed to `termfx.input.ESC` or
		`termfx.input.ALT`

`mode = termfx.outputmode([newmode])`
:	sets the terminal output mode. See the section on colors and
	attributes below. If the newmode argument was not given, returns the
	current output mode, otherwise returns the mode just set.

`evt = termfx.pollevent([timeout])`
:	waits for an event to occur. If the timeout argument is given, the
	function will time out after timeout milliseconds, otherwise it will
	wait forever. On Timeout, the function returns nil, on error it
	returns nil+error message, otherwise it returns a table with
	information about the event. Known events are `"key"` for a keyboard
	event, `"mouse"` for a mouse event or `"resize"` if the terminal was
	resized. Depending on which event occurred, the result table looks
	like this:

	For the event `"key"`:

	* `type`: `"key"`
	* `elapsed`: the number of milliseconds spent in `termfx.pollevent()`
	* `mod`: `nil` or `"ALT"`, no other modifiers are returned
	* `key`: the numeric code of the key pressed, if it was a special key
	* `ch`: the numeric code of the key pressed for standard keys
	* `char`: the char (possibly utf8 encoded) for ch

	either the field `key` or the field `ch` is nil. If the `key` field is
	not nil, it can be checked against one of the constants in `termfx.key`.
	If the `ch` field is not nil, it is the unicode value of the char that
	was pressed on the keyboard. In that case, the `char` field will
	contain a string containing the character represented by `ch`.

	For the event `"mouse"`:

	* `type`: `"mouse"`
	* `elapsed`: the number of milliseconds spent in `termfx.pollevent()`
	* `key`: the numeric code of the button pressed
	* `x`, `y`: the terminal coordinates where the mouse event occurred.

	on release of any button, the value of key will be
	termfx.key.MOUSE_RELEASED

	For the event `"resize"`:

	* `type`: `"resize"`
	* `elapsed`: the number of milliseconds spent in `termfx.pollevent()`
	* `w`: the new width
	* `h`: the new height

#### Buffer methods ####

The buffer created by `termfx.newbuffer()` has a few methods associated
with it. They work just like their global counterparts, only on the
buffer on which they are called. So for a detailed description of the
individual methods see above.

`buf:attributes([bg, fg])`
:	set or get default cell attributes for the buffer.

`buf:clear([fg, bg])`
:	clear the buffer.

`buf:setcell(x, y [, cel]) or buf:setcell(x, y [, ch [, fg [, bg]]])`
:	set a cell in the buffer.

`cel = buf:getcell(x, y)`
:	gets a cell from a buffer.

`buf:blit(x, y, src)`
:	blits the contents of the buffer src to position x, y of buffer buf.

`buf:rect(x, y, w, h [, cel]) or ok = buf:rect(x, y, w, h [, ch [, fg [, bg]]])`
:	draw a rectangle in the buffer.

`buf:copyregion(tx, ty, x, y, w, h)`
:	copy a region of the buffer.

`buf:scrollregion(x, y, w, h [, sx [, sy]])`
:	scrolls a region of the buffer.

`buf:printat(x, y, what [, w])`
:	print a string to the buffer.

`w = buf:width()`
:	return the buffer width.

`h = buf:height()`
:	return the buffer height.

`w, h = buf:size()`
:	return the buffer width and height.

### Colors and attributes ###

How TermFX handles colors depends on the chosen output mode. There are a
few functions to help you with the colors, these are `termfx.rgb2color()`,
`termfx.grey2color()`and `termfx.colorinfo()`, see the function list
above for an explanation of those functions. They work based on the
standard xterm colormap. If, for some reason, you have a different
colormap, these functions will not give you the results you want.

There are 8 predefined colors, which are available in all output modes:

* `termfx.color.BLACK`
* `termfx.color.RED`
* `termfx.color.GREEN`
* `termfx.color.YELLOW`
* `termfx.color.BLUE`
* `termfx.color.MAGENTA`
* `termfx.color.CYAN`
* `termfx.color.WHITE`

The output modes are:

`termfx.output.NORMAL`
:	this is an 8 color mode, in which only the 8 predefined colors are
	available as colors 1-8, plus a default color at position 0.

`termfx.output.COL256`
:	this is a mode with 256 colors.
	* the first 8 colors (0-7) are the 8 predefined colors.  
	* the next 8 colors (8-15) are the first 8 colors + `termfx.attr.BOLD`  
	* then (16-231) follow 216 different colors  
	* finally (232-255) 24 shades of grey

`termfx.output.COL216`
:	this is a mode that supports only the 3rd range of `COL256`, i.e. 216
	different colors, but ranging from 0-215. The 8 default colors are
	mapped to their closest representations in the palette.

`termfx.output.GRAYSCALE`
:	this is a mode in which only the 4th range from `COL256` is available,
	i.e. 24 shades of grey. but ranging from 0-23. The 8 default colors
	are mapped to grey values.

A table of the colors available for xterms is available here:  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm_%28software%29#mediaviewer/File:Xterm_256color_chart.svg>

The behaviour of the predefined colors is different from termbox, where
they only make sense for the `NORMAL` output mode. But this means that
they need to be determined for each output mode, which means that when
you for some reason cache the values from `termfx.color` or use them in
a buffer or a cell, and then switch output modes, you will need to
re-cache them, as they will have changed.

In addition to colors, cells can also have formatting attributes:

* `termfx.format.BOLD`
* `termfx.format.UNDERLINE`
* `termfx.format.REVERSE`

In order to construct a cell attribute, you can start with a color and
just add the desired formatting options to it (but only once, because,
of course, they are actually meant to be or'ed to the color)

### Key Constants ###

When `termfx.pollevent()` returns with a type field of "key" and its key
field set, then the value in the key field may be checked against one of
the constants in `termfx.key`, as listed below. However, due to window
managers interfering and whatnot, not all of these special keys may be
available to your terminal.

* `termfx.key.F1`
* `termfx.key.F2`
* `termfx.key.F3`
* `termfx.key.F4`
* `termfx.key.F5`
* `termfx.key.F6`
* `termfx.key.F7`
* `termfx.key.F8`
* `termfx.key.F9`
* `termfx.key.F10`
* `termfx.key.F11`
* `termfx.key.F12`
* `termfx.key.INSERT`
* `termfx.key.DELETE`
* `termfx.key.HOME`
* `termfx.key.END`
* `termfx.key.PGUP`
* `termfx.key.PGDN`
* `termfx.key.ARROW_UP`
* `termfx.key.ARROW_DOWN`
* `termfx.key.ARROW_LEFT`
* `termfx.key.ARROW_RIGHT`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_TILDE`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_2`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_A`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_B`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_C`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_D`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_E`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_F`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_G`
* `termfx.key.BACKSPACE`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_H`
* `termfx.key.TAB`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_I`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_J`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_K`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_L`
* `termfx.key.ENTER`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_M`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_N`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_O`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_P`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_Q`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_R`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_S`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_T`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_U`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_V`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_W`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_X`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_Y`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_Z`
* `termfx.key.ESC`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_LSQ_BRACKET`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_3`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_4`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_BACKSLASH`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_5`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_RSQ_BRACKET`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_6`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_7`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_SLASH`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_UNDERSCORE`
* `termfx.key.SPACE`
* `termfx.key.BACKSPACE2`
* `termfx.key.CTRL_8`

If mouse support is available, you also have these constants:

* `termfx.key.MOUSE_LEFT`
* `termfx.key.MOUSE_MIDDLE`
* `termfx.key.MOUSE_RIGHT`
* `termfx.key.MOUSE_RELEASE`
* `termfx.key.MOUSE_WHEEL_UP`
* `termfx.key.MOUSE_WHEEL_DOWN`

### Unicode ###

TermFX works with utf8 or plain 8 bit encoded charsets. Apart from the
encoding, TermFX makes no assumptions about the characters in a string.
Of course, in order to use utf8, the terminal has to support unicode. If
you need to manipulate utf8 encoded strings, use either lua 5.3 or a
proper utf8 library like
[luautf8](https://github.com/starwing/luautf8 "luautf8").

### Example ###

A very simple program using this library might look like this:

	tfx = require "termfx"
	tfx.init()
	tfx.clear(tfx.color.WHITE, tfx.color.BLACK)
	s = "Hello World"
	x = math.floor((tfx.width() - #s) / 2)
	y = math.floor(tfx.height() / 2)
	for i=1, #s do
		tfx.setcell(x, y, string.sub(s, i, i))
		x = x + 1
	end
	tfx.present()
	
	quit = false
	repeat
		evt = tfx.pollevent()
		quit = evt.char == "q"
	until quit
	tfx.shutdown()

You can find more examples in the samples directory.
